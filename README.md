Hello,

My name is Lucas (Luke is fine). You may also know me on the internet by my creator handle, CareFreeBomb. Nice to meet you!

Here you will find both a variety of personal projects as well as some resources I have created for fellow streamers.

I primarily work in TypeScript / JavaScript, but also have experience in C# / .NET, Java, PHP, and GSL / HLSL.

Please feel free to reach out professionally via [email](mailto:lucasjgerrits@gmail.com) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasgerrits/), or casually at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carefreeb0mb)!
